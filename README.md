## **User Stories**
#### User's Goals:
1. I want to make a deposit so that I can fund my account and play the slot machine.
2. I want to place a bet so that I can try my luck at winning.I want to see my current balance so that I can manage my funds effectively while playing.
3. I want to choose my bet amount so that I can control how much I risk on each spin.
4. I want to receive feedback on my bets so that I know if I won or lost after each spin.
5. I want to have the option to play again after each round, so I can continue enjoying the game without restarting the program.
6. I want to be welcomed with a friendly message when I start the game, to enhance my gaming experience.

#### Program Owner Goals:
1. I want to implement a feature to clear the console to enhance the user experience by keeping the interface clean.
2. I want to track user balances accurately to ensure fair play and maintain trust in the game.
3. I want an option that allows the user to continue gameplay, so if their funds hit Â£0.00 they get a
prompt to top up, make a deposit.
4. I want the program to replicate a spinning reel when the player places a bet, visual effect.

## **Future Features**



## **Validation**

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)

> While validating the functionality of my code to ensure it meets the required specifications and performs efficiently. I encountered <em>"line too long"</em> warnings. Despite my efforts to keep the lines concise, certain lines must remain long to ensure user feedback is communicated efficiently. Please see below, results from my **CI Python Linter**

![Validation](images-readme/CI-python-linter.png)

I also used [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) throughout the development of my program to ensure my code was behaving as it should. It was very useful for debugging, where it allowed me to see if there was any errors in patricular parts of my code, as the python tutor would simple not run specific blocks of code, or even provide incorrect outputs.



## **Manual Testing**

### Bugs and Fixes

> When the user lost and placed a `new_bet`, the balance was not decrementing to reflect the new bet. Bug found where in the code where the `new_balance` was not being updated to reflect the `new_bet` amount.

![Bug1](images-readme/bug-1.png)

**Code fix where `decrement_balance` function.**

![Fix1](images-readme/fix-bug1.1.png)

**Function being called correctly within the `slot_machine` function.**

![Fix1.1](images-readme/fix-bug1.png)

> Bug when user is prompted <em>"Would you like to make a deposit: y/n".</em> When the user typed "y" in this instance, nothing happened. The program should have displayed a message asking the user to top up there balance.

![Bug2](images-readme/bug-3.png)

**Bug fix in code where `new_balance += deposit_amount` was not assigned correctly, instead I had wrote `deposit_amount += new_balance`.**

![Fix2](images-readme/bug-fix2.png)

> As depicted in the below image, there is a trailing, `ls...` this bug was left over text from the print statement `print("Spinning the reels...", end="", flush=True)`.

![Bug3](images-readme/bug-4.png)

**A empty `print()` statement was added to ensure adequate spacing.**

![Fix3](images-readme/fix-3.png)

> Duplicated `program_banner` displayed every time a user choose to play again, this would continue to duplicate depending on how many times the user choose to play again, in this case the user only decided to play again once.

![Bug4](images-readme/bug-7.png)

**This bug was fixed by taken `clear_console` and `program_banner` function calls out of the `main()` function and placing them directly under each function as displayed in the image below. This ensured that the `clear_console` function was called at the beginning of the program and that the `program_banner` remained on the top of the program throughout.**

## **Error Handling - User Input**

* Valid name input:

  ![Valid name](images-readme/name-input.png)


* Valid bet amount: exceeding balance, providing a negative number or letters.

  ![Negative number](images-readme/negative-input.png)

  ![Exceeding balance](images-readme/over-betting-error.png)

  ![Providing Letters](images-readme/invalid-input.png)

* Valid (y/n) user input: This ensure the correct input, as before this validation was set if the user typed a number the program was treating it as if it was the user placing a bet.

## **Deployment**

The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

1. Sign in to Heroku and access the dashboard
2. In the top right corner, click the **"New"** dropdown menu and then click **"Create new app"**.
3. Choose a name for your app, then change your region accordingly.
4. Click **"Create app"**.
5. On the next page that loads after clicking **"Create app"**, click **"Settings"** in the top navigation bar.
6. Click on **"Reveal Config Vars"**
7. Add a new Config Var: type **'PORT'** in the **'KEY'** section, and type **'8000'** into the **'VALUE'** section, then click **"Add"**.
8. Next, scroll down to the **"Buildpack"** section and click **"Add buildpack"** they must be in order <em>heroku/python</em> then <em>heroku/nodejs</em> after.
9. In the top navigation bar, click the **"Deploy"** tab.
10. In the **"Deployment Method"** section, click on GitHub to connect to your GitHub account.
11. After logging into your GitHub account, search for your GitHub repository name (for this project, it was **"slot-royale"**)
12. Click on the repository once found to connect it.
13. Scroll down to the section **"Automatic Deploys"** and click on the **"Enable Automatic Deploys"** button
Then underneath, make sure the branch for the project is **"main"** and click on the **"Deploy"** button
Wait for Heroku to display that the app was deployed successfully.
1.  You can also choose **"manual deploy"**.
